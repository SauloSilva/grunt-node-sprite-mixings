# grunt-node-sprite-mixings [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SauloSilva/grunt-node-sprite-mixings.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SauloSilva/grunt-node-sprite-mixings)

> Mixing generator for stylus, from a json that contains the coordinates of the images on the sprite.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.2` and [node-sprite](https://github.com/naltatis/node-sprite) `~0.1.2`


## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-node-sprite-mixings --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-node-sprite-mixings');
```

## The "node_sprite_mixings" task

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `node_sprite_mixings` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  node_sprite_mixings: {
    files: {
      // task specifics
    }
  },
});
```

Before run the grunt-node-sprite-mixings task you must make sure that the sprite and json has been generated.

### Options

This task has just one option.

#### jsonRemove

jsonRemove: `Boolean` -
By `default` is  `false`, should you wish to delete the jsons after generation of the mixings.

### Usage Examples

#### One file per sprites

Coming together of all json sprites into a single mixing

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  node_sprite_mixings: {
    files: {
        dest: 'public/stylesheets/mixings/example.styl',
        src: ['public/images/*.json']
    }
  },
});
```

#### Multiple files per sprites

Mixings separated for every sprite.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  node_sprite_mixings: {
    basicAndExtras: {
        files: {
            'public/stylesheets/mixings/bar.styl': ['public/images/bar.json'],
            'public/stylesheets/mixings/foo.styl': ['public/images/foo.json']
        }
    },
  },
});
```

## Structural mixing expected / STYL

This is the format that is generated by mixing task:

```styl
  foo(repeat='no-repeat', x-offset=0, y-offset=0)
    background url('example-1.png') repeat (0 + x-offset) (442 + y-offset) transparent
```

## Stylus implementation

To use the mixings generated, just call into your file.styl as follows:

```styl
@import 'mixings/example'

.example
  foo()
```
Result of css:

```css
.example {
  background:url("example-1.png") 'no-repeat' 0 211 transparent;
}
```

## Structural Sprite Information required / JSON

The json that was specified in jsonFile, should be in this structure.
To learn how to produce this automatic json lib check out the [node-sprite](https://github.com/naltatis/node-sprite#usage), and see how to utilize.

```json
{
    "name": "example",
    "shortsum": "1",
    "images": [{
        "name": "foo",
        "positionX": 0,
        "positionY": 0
    }, {
        "name": "bar",
        "positionX": 0,
        "positionY": 442
    }]
}
```
